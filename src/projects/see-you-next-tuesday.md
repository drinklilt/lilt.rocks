Welcome to the world of the most innovative and provocative API ever created - See You Next Tuesday (CUNT) - the one and only API that accurately calculates the time until the next Tuesday.

No more counting days on your fingers or relying on your boring old calendar. With CUNT, you’ll never miss a Tuesday again! Whether it’s for Taco Tuesday or that dreadful meeting with your boss, CUNT’s got you covered.

And the best part? It’s completely free! So, if you want to make sure you don’t miss any upcoming Tuesdays, give CUNT a try.
